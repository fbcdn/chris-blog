			<p>Howdy. I'm Chris, I do a bunch of cybersecurity stuff with a focus on effective software security. My previous full-time role was with <a href="https://datto.com">Datto</a> as the Product Security Engineer leading the <a href="https://datto.com/networking">Datto Networking</a> organization's security efforts. Unfortunately due to economic pressure from COVID, a restructure was put into place and I was terminated along with many coworkers in the Networking organization (from Assoc. Software Engineer I, to Sr. Scrum Master II). We are all currently seeking employment, so if you have web, cloud, or firmware software/software security needs, do reach out over <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tweedge/">LinkedIn</a> to set up some time for us to talk!</p>

            <p>I try to be a jack-of-all-trades in my work to develop a more holistic view of the cybersecurity landscape. This has meant hopping between a number of roles before, during, and after my college career (<a href="https://rit.edu">RIT</a> CSEC BS '18). Thus far I've done everything from frontline IT, to information security strategy, to penetration testing, to software engineering in a high velocity & full-stack environment.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, I'd like to make it easier for technical and nontechnical people to be safe on the internet. Despite the <a href="https://github.com/swagitda/infosec-buzzword-bingo">InfoSec Bingo</a>-ness, much of the work I do revolves around security visibility and accessibility, which I stand by as core tenets of effective software security.</p>			

			<p>In pursuit of that, I maintain a product security resource/articles/thing called <a href="https://security.golf">SecurityGolf</a> where contributors and I publish neat content about product security strategy, governance, application, and more. You can find some examples of my personal technical research below, and some other work that I'm doing with some friends under a cybersecurity research entity, <a href="https://mns.llc">Machines Never Sleep, LLC</a>.</p>

			<h2>Presentations</h2>

			<h4>"Turning Domain Data into Domain Intelligence"</h4>
            <p>Authors: <i>Partridge, Chris.</i> Presented: <i>April 14, 2018 to Security B-Sides Rochester 2018 Hacker Conference.</i><br><br>A talk on the earlier rendition of Threatwork (then-titled 'dnstrace,' now a cooperative project under <a href="https://mns.llc">Machines Never Sleep, LLC</a>) and some of the interesting challenges of getting DNS data at scale, as well as fun statistics, unexpected misconfigurations, and some early results. You can see me sweat in front of peers for the first time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bqm0ZkJfFM">here</a>.</p>

			<h2>Publications</h2>

            <h4>"From Bear to Vault: Designing a New Protocol to Extend the APT Communications Toolset"</h4>

            <p>Authors: <i>Partridge, Chris; Hendee, Nicholas.</i> Accepted: <i>December 13-15, 2018 to the 2018 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence, in the Symposium on Cyber Warfare, Cyber Defense, and Cyber Security.</i><br><br>Investigating what contemporary APTs do for covert communication, we prototype a novel system combining the more potent ideas from a number of adversaries, which allows for highly flexible data exfiltration and C2 ... if you're willing to write some wrappers. Our paper is available <a href="https://american-cse.org/csci2018/pdfs/CSCI2018-3OvSlHpbnpxVCh7wjFqa17/dsybTn8QtwFaOJvB5AfpG/3MqFHlj5nPd6Ve3UmuBWti.pdf">here</a> from the American CSE proceedings portal, but if that goes down let me know and I'll reupload here, probably. I'm a new author so I don't actually know what I'm allowed to do yet.</p>
