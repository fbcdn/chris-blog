As some of you may know, I was laid off from my position as a Product Security Engineer in early May of this year, losing my first "real" cybersecurity job only six months in, amid one of the [worst economies ever](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/politics/what-matters-april-29/index.html). While tech has been semi-immune to the COVID catastrophe due to the ability to work from home, many tech companies have put [hiring freezes](https://candor.co/hiring-freezes/) on due to reduced cash flow. Combined with the [millions](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/05/class-of-2020-graduate-jobs/611917/) of freshly-graduated candidates and layoffs seen at cash-constrained tech companies, this was shaping up to be a slog. So, my new job was getting a job, and over the next couple months I would:

- Revamp my resume, CV, blog, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
- More than double my connections on LinkedIn.
- Manually apply for well over one hundred jobs.
- Take countless interviews and do coding interviews, security essay questions, etc.

...and much more, until I managed to get offers from five companies. This blog post will tell you what worked for me and what didn't at every step of my job search so you can (hopefully!) get connected with your next opportunity faster. It will be pragmatic and self-critical, and I'll include mistakes I made and caveats in my approach. Where possible, I've included data to help back my claims, though some numbers may be gently fudged to respect the privacy of persons or companies involved.

Do be warned - the tips I give in this post are tailored to people who have *some* foothold in the industry, ideally some relevant work experience, but could also be applied to other early-career professionals who have a STEM degree, been to bootcamps, or have strong recreational experience with tech (all options equally valid). If you're looking to start from scratch and jump into tech for the first time, I'd recommend taking a look at [Soatok's](https://soatok.blog/2020/06/08/furward-momentum-introduction/) blog series on the subject, which has more specific guidance for people starting out in tech.

## Disclaimer

I am not a career or recruiting expert, and am making no guarantees about your personal success. I'm just an internet fella who got some (very cool) jobs and took some notes. Notes which may or may not help you. Notes which may not even be accurate, especially years down the line. Don't blindly trust me, and don't blindly do everything that I did. Identify what key takeaways from my experience might help you and your job search based on your background, target verticals, timeline to find work, etc., validate them against your own opinions and experience, and use those to help propel yourself forward if you feel inclined to.

There are only a couple things that I can claim for sure: anything that I recommend contributed to my personal success in my recent job hunt. Further, I receive no compensation for their inclusion here, and I believe that personal articles giving advice to peers in tech *must* be honest and fully independent.

That's it. With those notes in mind, let's get started.

## Attitude

You've (probably) heard it before and you get to hear it again, but you need to be job-seeking with the right attitude about how you're managing yourself and your time. If you're anything like me, this wasn't how you planned to spend 2020, and it took a lot of getting used to. I admittedly lapsed briefly in my ability to deliver results in my own job search, so now you get to read about the two things I almost lost:

#### Discipline

From an emotional perspective, applying for jobs is a beat-down, and it's no fun hurling applications into the void to see what sticks. Don't take it personally, and try not to let it get to you. This isn't to diminish the frustration of being rejected from jobs - it sucked marking down my fortieth outright rejection last month, not counting the mountain of applications that I got no response to at all - and there was a day I felt so defeated that I just played video games and ordered takeout. That day was important for my well-being, but the more important day was the next one: I woke up, showered, ate, and continued searching.

#### Focus

From a time-management perspective, you no longer have a schedule, so you could just job hunt whenever, right? Wrong. Recruiters mostly work on regular office schedule, so dedicate a [block](https://www.forbes.com/sites/piasilva/2018/01/24/9-5-is-out-try-the-1-6-instead/) of time during the day that's doable for you every weekday, and maintain that schedule as best you can. Use that time to apply for jobs, schedule interviews, and work on your professional online presence. While I did personally hustle, this isn't meant to be [hustle porn](https://twitter.com/kvlly/status/1280917119417364485) - be respectful of your own time and happiness - but if you keep a consistent schedule it will be easier to network, better for your productivity, and keep you on track for success long-term.

## Strategy

Now you're ready to start your job search - being pumped up is optional - but what do you focus on first? What should you actually do to get a job outside of "just apply to stuff?" Robert Hellmann advises that you should approach your job search as a [numbers game](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthellmann/2018/09/15/want-to-get-hired-quickly-play-the-numbers-game-to-win/). You are more likely to see returns by taking an active and thoughtful approach to your job search, and casting a very wide net, planning on (among other things):

- Sending 200+ applications.
- Telling 200+ acquaintances in your network.
- Applying to diverse roles in new verticals or locations.
- Having at least six different meetings in the works at all times.

#### Adaptation

Having that broad strategy is good, but after that, turn it into something that plays to your strengths. For example, I am relatively fresh in the industry, so my network isn't very diverse and doesn't have much reach - I'll shore up the connections I do have from Datto of course, but I'll spend more time sending applications to compensate. I also set a goal for myself of securing a job around the ten week mark, and mapped out what I thought my time should look like every week so I could stay focused.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![The breakdown of time I expected to spend on each activity.](/2020/tech-job-hunting-compendium/time-expected-breakdown.png)
{: refdef}

You'll see this breakdown come up again, and here's what each (broad) category encapsulates:

- Preparation: Staying sharp on specific tech topics with research and studying.
- Update Assets: Prepare my LinkedIn, resume, CV, etc. Broadcast that I am seeking work.
- Applications: Submitting applications and completing associated challenges.
- Conversations:[^1] Networking and chats with recruiters which may lead to...
- Interviews: Technical or culture interviews which could lead up to an offer.
- Manage Offers: Negotiation and other conversations about offers.

## Visibility

Another complication to think about early is that most if not all of your job search is going to be online. The same goes in the reverse - in-person networking events have been mostly cancelled, so recruiters are searching nearly [100%](https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/sourcing-tools) online for new candidates. Speaking as someone who doesn't like the application process very much: the more opportunities that *find me*, the less work I have to do. The earlier you pump up your visibility, the more time you give opportunities to filter in, and therefore the better off you are.

There are many ways to help people find you for roles, many usual examples touted by "How To Get Hired in Tech" articles include having a super cool blog, publishing useful software packages, getting a bunch of followers on tech Twitter, ad infinitum. Though to be pragmatic, most of those are "not especially helpful" for visibility,[^2] and won't help recruiters find you unless they're quite popular. If you by chance have any popular repos or social media clout, of course use what you have: write a quick message to tell your network you're seeking employment, publish that alongside a normal update or your usual content, and see what that turns up! Just don't create a blog or cool project with the assumption that it will get you a job (or pay your bills), unless you are planning to spend a [year](https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it) or more building your audience. Even then, it's risky.

Among those usual suspects, a new way of being found has been popularized during COVID layoffs, which are public lists of terminated-due-to-COVID candidates that recruiters can search through, such as Candor's [Layoff Hiring List](https://candor.co/layoff-list). It's a free, public, searchable directory of candidates for recruiters to find new talent that you can add your name, headshot, blurb, resume, etc. to. Seems like a good idea, right? Well - maybe. It was a low time investment (~30 minutes) to get signed up to a handful of these, but I only had marketers reach out to me about free talks or paid services for job seekers, so it's hard for me to recommend it as "productive." I suppose the upside is high if a recruiter did reach out due to my presence on those lists, so I'd sign up again if I was laid off, but I'm compelled to note that you can't *rely* on your presence in hiring lists to bring you opportunities.

The important areas that I saw *real* results from were focusing on my LinkedIn and working with recruiting agencies, both of which I'll talk about in depth. This is possibly the most polarizing section of this article, so I'm obliged to remind you that what worked for me isn't necessarily the best solution for you. Further, neither of these is strictly required, and two offers I received were direct.

#### LinkedIn

LinkedIn is the anchor for my professional presence. It ties me to my network and provides great ways for opportunities to find me, but if you don't want to forsake your privacy, I totally get it. But if you *do* have or make a LinkedIn, make sure it is *[phenomenal](https://business.linkedin.com/en-uk/marketing-solutions/blog/posts/content-marketing/2017/17-steps-to-a-better-LinkedIn-profile-in-2017)*. Some of the key mistakes I see people looking for jobs making with their profile are:

- All of their past roles are listed, but none of them have any details. Titles mean much less than the experiences you had and the value you delivered! Write 1-3 short paragraphs per role: all content, no fluff. Prioritize details and length for roles that you really enjoyed or are similar to things you're looking for. This helps you show up in the right searches and shows anyone who views your profile much more about your background. This also shouldn't be identical to what you have in your resume, but it should be well-aligned - a good way to do this is to write a narrative for the bulleted items you have in your resume.
- Making their headline non-descriptive. You're "seeking employment" - in what? It's ok to tell people you're looking at the moment in your headline, but don't remove what your job *normally* is or people will gloss over you instead of clicking to look at your profile. Try "`$your_previous_title` Seeking Employment," or whatever role you're looking for.
- Introducing themselves in the third person. Your LinkedIn gets to be less formal than your resume. Unless you're explicitly hunting for traditional corporate workplaces, you may be better off presenting yourself in the first person with a friendly and warm tone, or closer to how you normally communicate.

Having done all of these correctly, you'll increase your search visibility and result quality when recruiters are seeking out new candidates. It really does help - I went from averaging seven views per week to fifteen views per week. Even better, I went from being approached about two opportunities per month to two opportunities per week, and those opportunities were more relevant to me. While it still took some time to filter out marketing spam or low-level irrelevant positions, I did have a number of productive conversations that started because I was approached over LinkedIn, both building my network and connecting me with great opportunities.

#### Recruiting Agencies

To get it out of the way, recruiting agencies get a difficult reputation because many agencies (especially staffing or temp agencies) that have been known to operate [unethically](https://recruiterbox.com/blog/how-to-spot-a-bad-recruitment-agency). An opportunity or two isn't worth betraying your professional ethics, damaging your network or references, or getting pigeonholed by weird contracts and fee schedules. If you get a bad feeling, *run* - if they have to resort to shady tactics when working with you, the offer they're trying to fill is not going to be worth it.

Assuming you know enough to weed out shady agencies, you still need to understand up front that you are the product they are selling, and schedule your expectations around that. Agencies have a bottom line, and that is "get paid." Some of them accomplish that by building short-term relationships and trying to shuffle you into a role immediately (this is often for lower pay, high churn or entry level jobs), while others are going to build long-term relationships and bring you roles that are better matches for you (often higher pay, but more specialized or requiring strong professional experience). Neither is inherently better than the other, and depending on where you are in your search or what professional experience you have at the moment, both can be great partners in your search.

Once you know the nuances and gotchas of working with agencies, I highly recommend at least talking to one or two. Of course they will match you to roles they are sourcing for, advocate for your success, nudge their client companies for updates, etc., but they're also a great resource to get honest[^3] feedback on:

- Job market trends or high priority technologies that companies are seeking.
- Improving your interview skills (if they receive that feedback, which they may or may not).
- Potential flaws or improvements on your LinkedIn, Resume, CV, etc.

In fact, nearly a third of my resume changed due to input from a recruiter I've worked with for several years, and getting personalized feedback on my resume from hiring professionals helped it stand out among hundreds of applications. This - and other changes that I made thanks to input from recruiters and self-reflection - helped to convert twice as many applications into conversations, and enhanced my ability to move from conversations into interviews.

## Resume

Before we dive into "shit Chris, what changed?" we need to get some table stakes out of the way. You, like me, probably have a resume that is "pretty good." It's not a lot of things - certainly not perfect, not as pretty as a digital designer would make, and not as well-worded as a writer could make - but it's clearly ours. This section is going to talk about how you can make your resume really work for you in your job search, as well as key tips from my experience both being recruited and recruiting, but is not going to be a general technical resume (re)writing guide. If you're feeling rusty or just want some more resources to look at, refresh yourself with these great sources:

- A detailed [guide](https://www.jobscan.co/resume-writing-guide) from Jobscan on writing a technical resume from scratch,
- An [article](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/10-resume-writing-tips) from Indeed with tips to strengthen an existing resume,
- And a phenomenal [opinion piece](https://hbr.org/2014/12/how-to-write-a-resume-that-stands-out) from HBR (Amy Gallo, Jane Heifetz) on resumes that stand out.

You didn't have to read those, but if you did, you should notice that some of the details between them are conflicting. Resume writing is an extremely opinionated part of your job search, and when searching for even simple information like "should my resume use color?" or "how long should my resume be?" you'll get screaming matches between hardline proponents of any conceivable answer. I am not experienced enough to dig my heels in on too many of these areas, save for two:

- *Do what's right for your resume.* No, seriously. It's your resume, and it's often your first chance to show people some facet of yourself. Are you a happy, bubbly person? Write an intro that reflects that! Are you more formal and career-oriented? Skip the intro, go straight to your recent experience. No recommendation should supersede your own personality - not even those!
- *Don't obsess over perfection.* Your resume will never be perfect. It will never be perfect for `$x` job, either. Focus on having something that's clear, well-written, and well-formatted. Update it, get some peers or professionals to review it (if you're inclined), and then get back to your job search. Remember, the [numbers game](#strategy) matters more.

But neither one of those was a change I needed to make. So what happened to my resume that suddenly started generating so many more results?

#### Tailoring

Tailor your resume to what you're looking for. No, don't waste your time to tailor your resume to every job - you should to be able to full send an unedited resume anytime - but you should be extremely cognizant of what *roles are generally looking for* and tailor to those. 

When a recruiter (or resume-scanning bot) turns you down, it's important to keep in mind that they've turned down your resume, not you. You have the ability to tune your resume for success, and you absolutely should do so.

#### Buzzwords

Love 'em. Know when & when not to use 'em.

## Applications

- job boards are eh
- generic CVs only
- places with long or immediate tech challenges aren't treating you fairly as a candidate unless they are also compensating you. keep challenges short & sweet. don't be afraid to duck out. opportunity cost.
- "what you made" == what you need to make, or ask for a range

There's one thing in particular that's changed in tech during COVID-ocalypse: the impact of a job's location. If you are working in tech right now, there's a good chance your company is working "remote until further notice." Any date your company had set in March as to when they expected their offices to reopen has been punted once, twice, or maybe more. Recruiters understand that people would likely not want to move during a pandemic - especially not to or from states with a higher infection rate per capita - and *every* recruiter I talked to working on a location-specific position said clearly:

> "We don't expect you to relocate right now, but we would within `$some_months` of our offices reopening, which is currently in `$fall_month` but might extend into next year."

That is a *lot* of flexibility if you don't have roots to a particular area. But even if you do, you could open up a discussion about turning that into a remote-only or remote-with-travel position. Will it be well-received? Maybe! Remote work is on the [rise](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/remote-work-statistics/) year-over-year and COVID has accelerated digital transformation for many companies. But it's best not to see location as a "hard requirement" right now - apply anyway and negotiate if there's mutual interest.

## Interviewing

- interview prep and coursework
- do you know anyone who is or has been at that company? can you find ex-employees?
- crush your technicals
- like riding a bike - the more you do it, the easier it gets.
- never bomb salary questions

Lastly, until I had an offer I would take, I kept searching like I expected not to get one. That lead to some awkward conversations when I ducked out of applications early in the process because there just wasn't going to be an opportunity to progress to the final round, but it was better than flunking the few finals I was betting on and having to pick up applying again.

## Negotiating Offers

- ask your network to help

Having such a structured schedule ended up being a good decision for an unexpected reason. Unemployment benefits helped carry me through this unexpected period in my life, but those benefits were contingent on not turning down any offers to work. Once I got my first offer, I'd only have a couple weeks before I would need to report that I declined, and likely lose my unemployment benefits. Further complicating things, [some](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecenizalevine/2018/05/08/unemployed-job-seekers-receive-lower-job-offers-how-to-get-a-good-job-offer-if-youre-unemployed/) companies won't offer competitive rates to people they know are unemployed for various reasons, which happened to me in late June. One company offered me ~35% below their *base pay* for engineers of the same title (as I heard from an insider I was in contact with), with a nebulous promise along the lines of "pay would be reevaluated after the country recovers from COVID."

## Footnotes

[^1]: It helps to look at early stage interviews and conversations with recruiting agencies, people in your network, etc. as one glob. Talking with recruiters before you move to interviews with other staff - while many are at least partially technical, ex. asking about your background or specific experiences - should be seen more as time for the candidate and company to get to know each other. That's more similar to what you do with your network and your recruiting firm, rather than the multi-hour gamuts that final interviews turn into.
[^2]: You *should* have a blog or code collaboration account if you have content for them, and some recruiters ([especially](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/what-do-job-seeking-developers-need-their-github) for software engineering roles) prefer to see contemporary examples of your code to supplement your resume. My comment here is only that those accounts won't help you get *found*, and I'll reiterate why they could still be important for *hiring* in the [Applications](#applications) section.
[^3]: Input from a recruiting firm inherently comes from their bottom line - recommendations they give you come from the jobs they (or their coworkers) are sourcing for, because that's what they know the market is looking for at the moment. It's often honest, but never perfectly objective - like this blog post.
