This is a compiled archive of what my EIP-Card-bearing letter looked like when it arrived on my doorstep. You'll notice it looks a lot like a scam or the product of identity theft. This is part of a [rant](/2020/eip-cards-made-fraud-easier/) on the subject which you may want to read, as this won't contextualize anything.

Also, if you get mail that looks like this, it might *actually* be a scam or a product of identity theft, so please validate any similar mail you receive about CARES Act disbursements against [this](/2020/eip-cards-made-fraud-easier/staying-safe/) safety guide.
