# Warning

The files distributed at and below this point in the repository tree are part of malicious extensions, which switch a browser's user agent to the user's preferred agent, and also abuses the user's Facebook and Instagram accounts for artificial influencer promotion. These could also be used for higher-impact purposes, and should be considered dangerous if run as it gives an external party significant control over your browser.

While its content can be included in this repository safely, do not package and load these extensions into your Chrome browser, as that would run it. Which is bad. As long as you explicitly choose not to do that - as it's a reasonably interactive process - this is safe to handle and inspect.

More information is available on my [article](https://chris.partridge.tech/2020/extensions-the-next-generation-of-malware/) about these extensions.
