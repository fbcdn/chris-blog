## Analysis

The key, of course, is to have as many browsers infected as possible, and generate likes with them frequently. Leaving this running for a while, I observed that an idle system is used to like content on Instagram as frequently as once every one-and-a-half minutes:

At an estimate of $0.01/like, 30 likes/hour, and 8 hours active/day ([thanks, COVID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK3QFL9akFg)), that's a cool $2.4/day/browser, doing activity which would be unnoticed by many users and can run on any system that can run Chrome.


## Notes

Likes include risk, but less risk than follows or other user-apparent content

Instagram should detect this based on traffic

Determining who is buying these resources is Sisyphean, which is mad props to the author.
