As some of you may know, I was laid off from my position as a Product Security Engineer at [Datto](https://datto.com) in early May of this year, losing my first "real" cybersecurity job only six months in, amid one of the [worst economies ever](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/politics/what-matters-april-29/index.html). While tech has been semi-immune to the COVID catastrophe due to the ability to work from home, many tech companies have put [hiring freezes](https://candor.co/hiring-freezes/) on due to reduced cash flow. Combined with the [hundreds of thousands](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/05/class-of-2020-graduate-jobs/611917/) of freshly-graduated candidates and layoffs seen at cash-constrained tech companies, this was shaping up to be a slog. So, my new job was getting a job, and over the next month I would:

- Revamp my resume, CV, blog, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
- More than double my connections on LinkedIn.
- Manually apply for well over one hundred jobs.
- Take countless interviews and do coding interviews, security essay questions, etc.

...and much more. This blog post will tell you what worked for me and what didn't at every step of my job search so you can (hopefully!) get connected with your next opportunity faster[^1]. It also assumes you have *some* foothold in the industry, ideally a STEM degree and/or relevant prior experience. If you're looking to start from scratch and jump into tech for the first time, I'd recommend taking a look at [Soatok's](https://soatok.blog/2020/06/08/furward-momentum-introduction/) blog series on the subject.

## 0. Attitude

Before we can talk about anything else, we need to talk about attitude. Yes, really.

You've (probably) heard it before and you get to hear it again, but you need to be job-seeking with the right attitude about how you're managing yourself and your time. If you're anything like me, this wasn't how you planned to spend 2020, and it took a lot of getting used to. I admittedly lapsed briefly in my ability to deliver results in my own job search, so now you get to read about the two things I almost lost:

#### Discipline

From an emotional perspective, applying for jobs is a beat-down, and it's no fun hurling applications into the void to see what sticks. Don't take it personally, and try not to let it get to you. This isn't to diminish the frustration of being rejected from jobs - it sucked marking down my fortieth outright rejection last month, not counting the mountain of applications that I got no response to at all - and there was a day I felt so defeated that I just played video games and ordered takeout. That day was important for my well-being, but the more important day was the next one: I woke up, showered, ate, and continued searching.

#### Focus

From a time-management perspective, you no longer have a schedule, so you could just job hunt whenever, right? Wrong. Recruiters mostly work on regular office schedule, so dedicate a [block](https://www.forbes.com/sites/piasilva/2018/01/24/9-5-is-out-try-the-1-6-instead/) of time during the day that's doable for you every weekday, and maintain that schedule as best you can. Use that time to apply for jobs, schedule interviews, and work on your professional online presence. While I did personally hustle, this isn't meant to be [hustle porn](https://twitter.com/kvlly/status/1280917119417364485) - be respectful of your own time and happiness - but if you keep a consistent schedule it will be easier to network, better for your productivity, and keep you on track for success long-term.

## 1. Strategy

Now you're ready to start your job search - being pumped up is optional - but what do you focus on first? What should you actually do to get a job outside of "just apply to stuff?" Robert Hellmann advises that you should approach your job search as a [numbers game](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthellmann/2018/09/15/want-to-get-hired-quickly-play-the-numbers-game-to-win/). You are more likely to see returns by taking an active and thoughtful approach to your job search, and casting a very wide net, planning on (among other things):

- Sending 200+ applications.
- Telling 200+ acquaintances in your network.
- Applying to diverse roles in new verticals or locations.
- Having at least six different meetings in the works at all times.

#### Adaptation

Having that understanding of a broad strategy is good, but after that, turn it into something that plays to your strengths. For example, I am relatively fresh in the industry, so my network isn't very diverse and doesn't have much reach - I'll shore up the connections I do have from Datto of course, but I'll spend more time sending applications to compensate. I also set a goal for myself of securing a job around the ten week mark, and mapped out what I thought my time should look like every week so I could stay focused.

![The breakdown of time I expected to spend on each activity.](/2020/tips-for-getting-a-tech-job-in-2020/time-expected-breakdown.png)
{: refdef}

You'll see this breakdown come up again, and here's what each (broad) category encapsulates:

- Preparation: Staying sharp on security topics with research and studying.
- Update Assets: Prepare my LinkedIn, resume, CV, etc. Broadcast that I am seeking work.
- Applications: Submitting applications and completing associated challenges.
- Conversations[^2]: Networking chats and early-stage interviews which may lead to...
- Interviews: Late-stage technical interviews which could result in an offer.
- Manage Offers: Negotiation and other conversations about offers.

## 2. Visibility

Another complication to think about early is that most if not all of your job search is going to be online. The same goes in the reverse - in-person networking events have been mostly cancelled, so recruiters are searching nearly [100%](https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/sourcing-tools) online for new candidates. Speaking as someone who doesn't like the application process very much: the more opportunities that *find me*, the less work I have to do. The earlier you pump up your visibility, the more time you give opportunities to filter in, and therefore the better off you are.

But, I also said this was going to be *practical tips only*. Truthfully, having a cool blog, GitHub, GitLab, Twitter, etc. are great things, but they won't drive visibility to recruiters unless they're quite popular. If you have any popular repos or social media clout, of course use it: write a quick message to tell your network you're seeking employment and see what that turns up! 

The more important areas that I saw results from were focusing on my LinkedIn and working with staffing firms. This is possibly the most polarizing section of this article, so I'm obliged to remind you that what worked for me isn't necessarily the best solution for you. Further, neither of these is strictly required, and some offers I received depended on neither of these.

#### LinkedIn

LinkedIn is the anchor for my professional presence. It ties me to my network and provides great ways for opportunities to find me, but if you don't want to forsake your privacy, I totally get it. If you *do* have or make a LinkedIn, make sure it is *[phenomenal](https://business.linkedin.com/en-uk/marketing-solutions/blog/posts/content-marketing/2017/17-steps-to-a-better-LinkedIn-profile-in-2017)*. Some of the key mistakes I see people looking for jobs making with their profile are:

- Making their headline non-descriptive. You're "seeking employment" - in what? It's ok to tell people you're looking at the moment in your headline, but don't remove what your job *normally* is or people will gloss over you instead of clicking to look at your profile. Try "`$your_previous_title` Seeking Employment."
- Introducing themselves in the third person. Your LinkedIn gets to be less formal than your resume. Unless you're explicitly hunting for traditional corporate workplaces, you may be better off presenting yourself in the first person with a friendly and warm tone, or closer to how you normally communicate.
- All of their past roles are listed, but none of them have any details. Titles mean much less than the experiences you had and the value you delivered! Write 1-3 short paragraphs (or equivalent listed items, your choice) per role: all content, no fluff. Prioritize details and length for roles that you really enjoyed or are similar to things you're looking for. This helps you show up in the right searches and shows anyone who views your profile much more about your background.

Having done all of these correctly, you'll increase your search visibility and result quality when recruiters are seeking out new candidates. It really does help - I went from averaging seven views per week to fifteen views per week, and went from being solicited about two opportunities per month to three opportunities per week (and those opportunities were more relevant to me, too!).

#### Staffing Firms

To get it out of the way, staffing firms get a difficult rep because of many staffers that have been known to operate [unethically](https://recruiterbox.com/blog/how-to-spot-a-bad-recruitment-agency). An opportunity or two isn't worth betraying your professional ethics, damaging your network or references, or getting pigeonholed by weird contracts and fee schedules. If you get a bad feeling, *run* - if they have to resort to shady tactics when working with you, the offer they're trying to fill is not going to be worth it.

Even if you do work with a staffing firm, you need to understand up front that you are the product they are selling, and schedule your expectations around that. Staffing firms have a bottom line, and that is "get paid." Some of them accomplish that by building short-term relationships and trying to shuffle you into a role immediately (this is often for lower pay, high churn or entry level jobs), while others are going to shoot for long-term relationships and bring you roles that are better matches for you (often higher pay, but more specialized or requiring strong professional experience).

Neither is inherently better than the other, and depending on where you are in your search or what professional experience you have at the moment, both can be great partners in your search. Of course they will match you to roles they are sourcing for, advocate for your success, nudge their client companies for updates, etc., but they're also a great resource to get honest[^3] feedback on:

- Job market trends or high priority technologies that companies are seeking.
- Potential flaws or improvements on your LinkedIn, Resume, CV, etc.
- Improving your interview skills (if they receive that feedback, which they may not).

So with all the footnotes and gotchas, do I recommend working with staffing firms? Yes - I even recommend working with multiple, because they increase your reach and frequently provide expert guidance if you ask. Working with multiple also allows you to get differing opinions and cross-check what you're being advised to make sure it's accurate[^4].

## 3. Resume



- two pages
- tech buzzwords a plus, but be defensible
- 

## 4. Applications

- job boards

There's one thing in particular that's changed in tech during COVID-ocalypse: the impact of a job's location. If you are working in tech right now, there's a good chance your company is working "remote until further notice." Any date your company had set in March as to when they expected their offices to reopen has been punted once, twice, or maybe more. Recruiters understand that people would likely not want to move during a pandemic - especially not to or from states with a higher infection rate per capita - and *every* recruiter I talked to working on a location-specific position said clearly:

> "We don't expect you to relocate right now, but we would within `$some_months` of our offices reopening, which is currently in `$fall_month` but might extend into next year."

That is a *lot* of flexibility if you don't have roots to a particular area. But even if you do, you could open up a discussion about turning that into a remote-only or remote-with-travel position. Will it be well-received? Maybe! Remote work is on the [rise](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/remote-work-statistics/) year-over-year and COVID has accelerated digital transformation for many companies. But it's best not to see location as a "hard requirement" right now - apply anyway and negotiate if there's mutual interest.

## 5. Interviewing

Lastly, until I had an offer I would take, I kept searching like I expected not to get one. That lead to some awkward conversations when I ducked out of applications early in the process because there just wasn't going to be an opportunity to progress to the final round, but it was better than flunking the few finals I was betting on and having to pick up applying again.

## 6. Negotiating Offers

Having such a structured schedule ended up being a good decision for an unexpected reason. Unemployment benefits helped carry me through this unexpected period in my life, but those benefits were contingent on not turning down any offers to work. Once I got my first offer, I'd only have a couple weeks before I would need to report that I declined, and likely lose my unemployment benefits. Further complicating things, [some](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecenizalevine/2018/05/08/unemployed-job-seekers-receive-lower-job-offers-how-to-get-a-good-job-offer-if-youre-unemployed/) companies won't offer competitive rates to people they know are unemployed for various reasons, which happened to me in late June. One company offered me ~35% below their *base pay* for engineers of the same title (as I heard from an insider I was in contact with), with a nebulous promise along the lines of "pay would be reevaluated after the country recovers from COVID."

## 7. Review

## Footnotes

[^1]: I am not a career or recruiting expert, and am making no guarantees about your personal success - what worked for me may not work at all for you. Further, any companies, platforms, etc. that I recommended contributed to my personal success in my recent job hunt. I receive no compensation for their inclusion here, and I believe that personal articles giving advice to peers in tech *must* be honest and fully independent.
[^2]: It helps to look at early stage interviews and conversations with staffing firms, people in your network, etc. as one glob. Early-stage interviews - while many are at least partially technical - are less about the technical questions themselves and should be seen more as time for the candidate and company to get to know each other. That's more similar to what you do with your network and your staffing firm, rather than the longer multi-hour setups that final interviews turn into.
[^3]: Input from a staffing firm inherently comes from their bottom line - recommendations they give you come from the jobs they (or their coworkers) are sourcing for, because that's what they know the market is looking for at the moment. It's honest, but not perfectly objective.
