## Presentations

#### "Turning Domain Data into Domain Intelligence"
##### Authors: Partridge, Chris.
##### Presented: April 14, 2018 to Security B-Sides Rochester 2018 Hacker Conference.

A talk on the earlier rendition of Threatwork (then-titled 'dnstrace,' now a cooperative project under [Machines Never Sleep, LLC](https://mns.llc), and some of the interesting challenges of getting DNS data at scale. This talk also went over some fun statistics, unexpected misconfigurations, and early results (positive, but not amazing). You can see me sweat in front of peers for the first time [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bqm0ZkJfFM).

Investigating what contemporary APTs do for covert communication, we prototype a novel system combining the more potent ideas from a number of adversaries, which allows for highly flexible data exfiltration and C2 ... if you're willing to write some wrappers.
