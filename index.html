			<p>Howdy. I'm Chris, I do a bunch of cybersecurity stuff. Certain people (<a href="https://datto.com">Datto</a>) are currently paying me as an application security engineer to make their networking line of products more secure. I burn that money and my free time on my own company (<a href="https://mns.llc">Machines Never Sleep, LLC</a>) which does bleeding-edge cybersecurity research with a small team of nerds on staff.</p>

            <p>I try to be a jack-of-all-trades in my work to develop a more holistic view of the cybersecurity landscape. This has meant hopping between a number of roles before, during, and after my college career (<a href="https://rit.edu">RIT</a> CSEC BS '18). Thus far I've done everything from frontline IT, to information security strategy, to penetration testing, to software engineering in a high velocity & full-stack environment.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, I'd like to make it easier for technical and nontechnical people to be safe on the internet. Security visbility and accessibility are main goals of mine in most of the work that I do. Below you'll find some notable examples, and maybe a blog someday when I get around to it.</p>

            <p>Oh, and if you'd like to connect further, shoot me a request on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tweedge/">LinkedIn</a>. Thanks!</p>

			<h2>Presentations</h2>

			<h4>"Turning Domain Data into Domain Intelligence"</h4>
            <p>Authors: <i>Partridge, Chris.</i> Presented: <i>April 14, 2018 to Security B-Sides Rochester 2018 Hacker Conference.</i><br><br>A talk on the earlier rendition of Threatwork (then-titled 'dnstrace,' now a cooperative project under <a href="https://mns.llc">Machines Never Sleep, LLC</a>) and some of the interesting challenges of getting DNS data at scale, as well as fun statistics, unexpected misconfigurations, and some early results. You can see me sweat in front of peers for the first time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bqm0ZkJfFM">here</a>.</p>

			<h2>Publications</h2>

            <h4>"From Bear to Vault: Designing a New Protocol to Extend the APT Communications Toolset"</h4>

            <p>Authors: <i>Partridge, Chris; Hendee, Nicholas.</i> Accepted: <i>December 13-15, 2018 to the 2018 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence, in the Symposium on Cyber Warfare, Cyber Defense, and Cyber Security.</i><br><br>Investigating what contemporary APTs do for covert communication, we prototype a novel system combining the more potent ideas from a number of adversaries, which allows for highly flexible data exfiltration and C2 ... if you're willing to write some wrappers. Our paper is available <a href="https://american-cse.org/csci2018/pdfs/CSCI2018-3OvSlHpbnpxVCh7wjFqa17/dsybTn8QtwFaOJvB5AfpG/3MqFHlj5nPd6Ve3UmuBWti.pdf">here</a> from the American CSE proceedings portal, but if that goes down let me know and I'll reupload here, probably. I'm a new author so I don't actually know what I'm allowed to do yet.</p>
