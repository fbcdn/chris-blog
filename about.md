Howdy - again! I'm Chris, a ~~basement-dweller~~ ~~eboy~~ cybersecurity fella on the internet. At the moment, I work with midsize businesses to help build or expand security practices, particularly around software engineering.

I try to be a jack-of-all-trades in my work to develop a more holistic view of the cybersecurity landscape. This has meant hopping between a number of roles before, during, and after my college career ([RIT CSEC](https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computing-security) BS '18, with a minor in Psychology). Thus far I've done everything from frontline IT, to information security strategy, to penetration testing, to software engineering in a high velocity & full-stack environment.

Ultimately, I'd like to make it easier for technical and nontechnical people to be safe on the internet. Despite the [InfoSec Bingo](https://github.com/swagitda/infosec-buzzword-bingo)-ness, much of the work I do revolves around security visibility and accessibility, which I stand by as core tenets of effective software security.

In pursuit of that, I maintain a product security resource/articles/thing called [SecurityGolf](https://security.golf) where contributors and I publish neat content about product security strategy, governance, application, and more. You can find some examples of my personal technical research [here](http://localhost:4000/research/), and some other work that I'm doing with some friends under a cybersecurity research entity, [Machines Never Sleep, LLC](https://mns.llc).

I also play a smidge of D&D and love cooking for myself & others. Maybe I'll start a food blog too. Anything is possible!

## Seeking Employment

Dear reader - I do have something to ask of you as well. My previous full-time role was with [Datto](https://datto.com) as the Product Security Engineer leading the [Datto Networking](https://datto.com/networking) organization's security efforts. Unfortunately due to economic pressure from COVID, a restructure was put into place and I was terminated along with many coworkers in the Networking organization (from Assoc. Software Engineer I, to Sr. Scrum Master II). We are all currently seeking employment, so if you have web, cloud, or firmware software/software security needs, do reach out over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tweedge/) to set up some time for us to talk!

## What is "tweedge"?

The moniker I use came from a close friend. Chris "Partridge" became "Partweedge" - the "ee" sound mostly from howling it in laughter - and then eventually just "'tweedge." It stuck for years, and I'm happy to have it be my handle these days.
